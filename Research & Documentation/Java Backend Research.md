# Java Framework, Spring Boot or Quarkus
### Sources
Spring Boot has better documentation and more material than we can find online. Quarkus is improving in this area and has a vast set of features that helps increase productivity. However, considering documentation and stack overflow issues, it's still behind.
Quarkus was faster than Spring Boot in terms of startup time both in JVM and native versions. Furthermore, Quarkus build time was also much quicker in the case of native images. The build took 91 seconds (Quarkus) vs 113 seconds (Spring Boot), and the JVM build took 5.24 seconds (Quarkus) vs 1.75 seconds (Spring Boot). 

Both Quarkus and Spring Boot are extensive frameworks for developing and deploying Java based enterprise applications. So which one is right for your project?
Quarkus is a newer framework but more innovative than Spring Boot. It boasts fast application boot times, live coding features and an overall excellent developer experience. The main issue is less community support and the lack of beginner-friendly resources.
On the other hand, Spring Boot is mature, well-known and stable. It has extensive features, template design patterns and is highly secure. It also has excellent documentation and community support, which can help solve the majority of issues faced during development. The major cons of Spring Boot are poorer performance and higher memory consumption compared to Quarkus.
Therefore, choosing between Quarkus and Spring Boot for building your application will depend on the requirements of your project, technological preferences and developer skill level.

### Conclusion
From online research I tend to use Spring Boot, since it has more documentation, which will be helpful in learning this new technic. On the other hand the live coding feature from Quarkus can be very useful in learning the technic, since you donâ€™t have to reload your program whenever you change minor things in the code.

I attended a workshop for Quarkus from Mark Heumen in which we learned the basics from Quarkus to setup the backend with the REST API. After the workshop I also made a small project in Spring Boot.
From personal testing I prefer to use the Spring Boot framework since it has a lot of documentation and examples, which outweighs the live coding feature.
