# Agile

## What is agile?
Working Agile is not a way of working on a project, but Agile is a mindset on how to work/plan your project. Working Agile is a iterative process, where you often deliver new features, every few weeks. This can be done with Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming. These frameworks are all different, but they have the same mindset on how to work. This mindset has been created by 17 people, which they call the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. This Manifesto consists of 4 values and 12 principles. These values are:
<ul>
  <li> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. </li>
  <li> Working software over comprehensive documentation. </li>
  <li> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. </li>
  <li> Responding to change over following a plan. </li>
</ul>

### Advantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> You can deploy software quicker, so your customer can get value sooner rather than later. </li>
  <li> You can better adapt to change and respond faster. </li>
  <li> You can experiment and test ideas because its costs are low. </li>
  <li> Developers can improve their skills based on QA feedback. </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> Documentation tends to get sidetracked, which makes it harder for new members to get up to speed. </li>
  <li> Agile demands more time and energy from everyone because developers and customers must constantly interact with each other. </li>
  <li> Features that are too big to fit into one or even several cycles are avoided because they don't fit in nicely into the philosophy. </li>
</ul>

## Agile frameworks
There are a lot of different frameworks, each different from eachother, but also a lot of similarities. I researched the 4 bigger Agile frameworks which are Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming & Lean Development.

## Scrum
Scrum is characterised by cycles of development, known as sprints, and by the maximisation of development time for a software product towards a goal, the Product Goal. This Product Goal is a larger value objective, in which sprints bring the scrum team product a step closer. This framework is mostly used in software development, but it could also be used in business management. Every day starts with a small 15-minute meeting, the daily Scrum or stand-up, which takes the role of synchronising activities and finding the best way to plan out the working day, allowing for a check on the product progress.

### Advantages
<ul>
  <li> Team motivation is good because programmers want to meet the deadline for every sprint. </li>
  <li> Transparency allows the project to be followed by all the members in a team or even throughout the organisation. </li>
  <li> A simple “definition of done” is used for validating requirements. </li>
  <li> Focus on quality is a constant with the scrum method, resulting in fewer mistakes. </li>
  <li> The dynamics of this method allow developers to reorganise priorities, ensuring that sprints that have not yet been completed get more attention. </li>
  <li> Good sprint planning is prioritised, so that the whole scrum team understands the “why, what and how” of allocated tasks. </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages
<ul>
  <li> The segmentation of the project and the search for the agility of development can sometimes lead the team to lose track of the project as a whole, focusing on a single part. </li>
  <li> Every developer role may not be well defined, resulting in some confusion amongst team members. </li>
</ul>

## Kanban
The Kanban method is organised on a Kanban board, divided into columns, showing every flow within the software production project, as shown below. As the development evolves, the information contained in the table changes, and whenever a new task comes into play, a new card is created. This methodology is like Scrum also usable in other branches than just Software Development. The Kanban method requires communication and transparency so that the members of any team all know exactly what stage development is at and can see the status of a project at any time. It primarily focused on team capacity and is best for processes that undergo small changes.

### Advantages
<ul>
  <li> Ability to view all the tasks under a single project (by Completed, In Progress or In testing, for example) using the simple concept of Cards. </li>
  <li> You can limit the number of running tasks (that is, the amount of work, bearing its resolution or deliverability in mind) </li>
  <li> Focuses on the duration of a cycle – how long it takes a task to go from backlog to final stage </li>
  <li> Allows continuous deliveries </li>
  <li>  </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages
<ul>
  <li> It’s possible for team members to misinterpret the information shown on the Kanban Board, especially when it is shown as outdated. </li>
  <li> Since there are no timeframes in Kanban, you can face time-related problems, such as delays, at each and every stage. </li>
</ul>

## Extreme Programming (XP)
This is a framework which is fully focused on Software Development, this framework is not functional to use in other branches of a business. Extreme Programming methodology is based around the idea of discovering “the simplest thing that will work” without putting too much weight on the long-term product view. It is a methodology that emphasises values such as Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage and Respect, and prioritises customer satisfaction over everything else. This methodology encourages trust by motivating developers to accept changes in customer requirements, even if they arrive during the latter stages of the development cycle. Teamwork is extremely important in XP, since, when there is a problem, it is solved by the whole team of managers, developers or customers, bringing them together to promote conversation and engagement and break down barriers to communication. They all become essential pieces of the same puzzle, creating a fertile environment for high productivity and efficiency within teams. In Extreme Programming, the software is tested from day one, collecting feedback to improve development. XP promotes activities such as pair programming, and with a strong testing component, it’s an excellent engineering methodology.

### Advantages
<ul>
  <li> The simplicity of the written code is an advantage since it allows for improvement at any given time. </li>
  <li> The whole process and the XP development cycle is visible, creating goals for developers along with relatively rapid results. </li>
  <li> Software development is more agile than when using other methodologies, due to constant testing. </li>
  <li> Promotes a highly energising way of working. </li>
  <li> XP also contributes to uplifting and maintaining team talent. </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages
<ul>
  <li> The extreme focus on code can lead to less importance being paid to design, meaning that it has to get extra attention later. </li>
  <li> This framework may not work at its best if all the team members are not situated in the same geographical area. </li>
  <li> In XP projects, a registry of possible errors is not always maintained, and this lack of monitoring can lead to similar bugs in the future. </li>
</ul>
