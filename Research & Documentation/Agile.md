# Agile

## What is agile?
Working Agile is not a way of working on a project, but Agile is a mindset on how to work/plan your project. This can be done with Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming. These frameworks are all different, but they have the same mindset on how to work. This mindset has been created by 17 people, which they call the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. This Manifesto consists of 4 values and 12 principles. These values are:
<ul>
  <li> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools </li>
  <li> Working software over comprehensive documentation </li>
  <li> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation </li>
  <li> Responding to change over following a plan </li>
</ul>

### Advantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> You can deploy software quicker, so your customer can get value sooner rather than later </li>
  <li> You can better adapt to change and respond faster </li>
  <li> You can experiment and test ideas because its costs are low </li>
  <li> Developers can improve their skills based on QA feedback </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> Documentation tends to get sidetracked, which makes it harder for new members to get up to speed </li>
  <li> Agile demands more time and energy from everyone because developers and customers must constantly interact with each other </li>
  <li> Features that are too big to fit into one or even several cycles are avoided because they don't fit in nicely into the philosophy </li>
</ul>

## Agile frameworks
There are a lot of different frameworks, each different from eachother, but also a lot of similarities. I researched the five bigger Agile frameworks which are Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Lean Development & Crystal.
