# Agile

## What is agile?
Working Agile is not a way of working on a project, but Agile is a mindset on how to work/plan your project. Working Agile is a iterative process, where you often deliver new features, every few weeks. This can be done with Agile frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming. These frameworks are all different, but they have the same mindset on how to work. This mindset has been created by 17 people, which they call the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. This Manifesto consists of 4 values and 12 principles. These values are:
<ul>
  <li> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools </li>
  <li> Working software over comprehensive documentation </li>
  <li> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation </li>
  <li> Responding to change over following a plan </li>
</ul>

### Advantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> You can deploy software quicker, so your customer can get value sooner rather than later </li>
  <li> You can better adapt to change and respond faster </li>
  <li> You can experiment and test ideas because its costs are low </li>
  <li> Developers can improve their skills based on QA feedback </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages of working Agile
<ul>
  <li> Documentation tends to get sidetracked, which makes it harder for new members to get up to speed </li>
  <li> Agile demands more time and energy from everyone because developers and customers must constantly interact with each other </li>
  <li> Features that are too big to fit into one or even several cycles are avoided because they don't fit in nicely into the philosophy </li>
</ul>

## Agile frameworks
There are a lot of different frameworks, each different from eachother, but also a lot of similarities. I researched the 4 bigger Agile frameworks which are Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming & Lean Development.

## Scrum
Scrum is characterised by cycles of development, known as sprints, and by the maximisation of development time for a software product towards a goal, the Product Goal. This Product Goal is a larger value objective, in which sprints bring the scrum team product a step closer. This framework is mostly used in software development, but it could also be used in business management. Every day starts with a small 15-minute meeting, the daily Scrum or stand-up, which takes the role of synchronising activities and finding the best way to plan out the working day, allowing for a check on the product progress.

### Advantages
<ul>
  <li> Team motivation is good because programmers want to meet the deadline for every sprint </li>
  <li> Transparency allows the project to be followed by all the members in a team or even throughout the organisation </li>
  <li> A simple “definition of done” is used for validating requirements </li>
  <li> Focus on quality is a constant with the scrum method, resulting in fewer mistakes </li>
  <li> The dynamics of this method allow developers to reorganise priorities, ensuring that sprints that have not yet been completed get more attention </li>
  <li> Good sprint planning is prioritised, so that the whole scrum team understands the “why, what and how” of allocated tasks. </li>
</ul>

### Disadvantages
<ul>
  <li> The segmentation of the project and the search for the agility of development can sometimes lead the team to lose track of the project as a whole, focusing on a single part </li>
  <li> Every developer role may not be well defined, resulting in some confusion amongst team members. </li>
</ul>
