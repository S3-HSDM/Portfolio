# Cultural differences & Ethics

## Ethics
### What is ethics in Software Engineering?
Before we can research Ethics I needed to know what Ethics exactly is. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) Ethics is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. This explains the general meaning of ethics, but what is Ethics in software engineering? To create a general view on ethics in software engineering a Code of Ethics is introduced, which contains 8 principles. A short version of this Code can be on [Computer.org](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics). With the introduction of this Code of Ethics all software engineers can match eachother in ethical considerations.

Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
1. **PUBLIC:** Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. **CLIENT AND EMPLOYER:** Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
3. **PRODUCT:** Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. **JUDGMENT:** Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. **MANAGEMENT:** Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
6. **PROFESSION:** Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. **COLLEAGUES:** Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. **SELF:** Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

The practice of ethics has not traditionally been a part of software development. Software didn't always have a direct impact on daily life, and the pace of development was slow. In modern society, people encounter software in all aspects of life, and big data and data analytics have real ramifications for individuals. Although software developers work primarily behind the scenes in businesses, their decisions in the course of a project can have an outsized impact in the world, for better or worse. Everyone in the industry should be aware of social and ethical issues in software development and thus the importance of Ethics in software engineering have increased a lot in the last years.

### Why is ethics important in Software Engineering?
There are 3 main points that indicate the importance of ethics in software engineering, it benefits the public, it meets professional standards & it provides high-quality software.

#### Ethics benefits the public 
Having a strict code of ethics guarantees that software engineers will create products that benefit everyday people. Without ethics, a software engineer could disregard how their work affects the lives of others, or design something that is intentionally harmful. Software should be looked upon as a tool to help our society function more efficiently. Without ethics, software engineers could get off scot-free for participating in reckless behaviour and decision-making. 

#### Ethics meets professional standards
Adhering to your own personal ethics isn’t enough. Professional standards governed by a code of ethics ensure that software engineers are able to justify their work. Rather than pursuing a goal without first thinking of its implications, employees in this field need to ask themselves a few ethical questions each time they embark on a new project. For example, a software engineer who is developing a new video game may ask themselves, “How can I make sure that the final product does not negatively impact a player’s quality of life?”. Having a code that meets professional standards also means that software engineers are part of a moral community of like-minded professionals and leaders with similar responsibilities. Remember, the influence of a good principal can never be erased!

#### Ethics provides high-wuality software
Software powers our world. It enables the functionality of our banks, communication, power plants, and nearly every other modern-day system. Ethics make certain these systems use high-quality, reliable software that is beneficial and accessible for everyone. According to the Code, software engineers must aim to create quality products that meet specifications, pass appropriate tests, and don’t diminish quality of life, privacy, or harm the environment. 

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?
#### Ask yourself how the software could be misused 
Most engineers create software in good faith. Unfortunately, assuming that your product will be used for good isn’t enough. Each time you embark on a new project, ask yourself, “How could this software be misused?”. Be mindful that this answer may change as the product itself evolves. Ask yourself this question multiple times throughout the development process and each time you update it. For example, the team that developed Twitter did so with a mission to “give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly,” and likely didn’t think that the platform would one day be used to spread misinformation about a global pandemic or electoral processes. To offset some of this harm, Twitter platform implemented a crisis misinformation policy to guide their efforts to elevate credible information in 2022. As a software engineer, you should also look at existing technology you’ve worked on and be proactive about addressing potential misuse. 

#### Be honest about your intent
If you publicly announce that your new product will “connect individuals from across the globe” but your actual goal is to make the next greatest international dating app, you’re not adhering to software engineering ethics. Use simple language and be honest about your product! If the vision changes, inform your audience. Be open with stakeholders about software updates and changes as they arise. Work with other teams within your company to create policies that make sure the product will be used as intended. 

#### Avoid biases
If you’re an idealistic person, you probably get excited often about your own work. Don’t let enthusiasm cloud your judgment! Think carefully about your role as a digital changemaker and always ask for a second option if you’re questioning the ethicality of your work. Commit to the eight principles of the Code, which outlines how software engineers should be lifelong learners. If you’re a manager, strive to create a diverse team of software engineers who are able to share their own options and perspectives on each project your team undertakes.

#### Take accountability for the software 
If you have an awesome idea, take ownership for all successes and failures! As a software engineer, you should aim to advance the integrity and reputation of the profession. For example, you should avoid false claims about your software, but also declarations that could be deceptive or misleading. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in your software and ensure that your employer, clients, customers, and other stakeholders are kept up-to-date. 

#### Act as a responsible citizen
Software engineers have the unique opportunity to create a product that can unknowingly do good or cause harm. For this reason, you need to put your role as a responsible citizen first and as a software engineer second. You should only work on and move forward with the development of  software that you believe is safe, meets requirements, and can pass the necessary testing. You can also be a responsible citizen by volunteering your professional engineering skills to good causes when able. 

### Examples of Ethical issues in software engineering
There are a lot of ethical issues to consider when creating a project. Here I discuss 5 examples of ethical issues and consider if those issues could be an issue for my own project. The 5 examples are:
- Addictive design
- Corporate ownership of personal data
- Algorithmic bias
- Weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection
- Overemphasis on features

#### Addictive design
Every developer yearns to create applications that people love to use, that's just good UX design. The problem is that some teams craft apps that people love too much. There is an ethical concern about the role of digital platforms, such as social media. Striking an ethical balance between products consumers love and products that hijack their attention is more an art than a science. In product creation and updates, ask the following questions:
- Who benefits?
- How do they benefit?
- To what degree do they benefit?
- Are there safeguards for user health and sanity?
- How overt is monetization and customer data collection and use, including via AI and machine learning (ML)? How transparent are these practices?

#### Questionable personal data ownership
AI-based processing of biometric and other contextual data about customers has increased exponentially with device and software evolution. Software can profile users and predict behaviors at a scary level of detail. "Usually, the ethical question is what to do with that data," said Miguel Lopes, vice president of product line management at Vidyo, a video conference platform. This ethical issue is a dilemma for developers in every kind of business, not just the social media giants who make the news. An algorithm directs information collection and building a profile, but the subsequent actions are intentional, and the developer is ordinarily aware of the power of this data in context. One of the root causes of ethical concerns relates to how the business generates revenue and incentivizes developers and business managers, Lopes argued. In many cases, companies look at user data as a valuable currency, and want to monetize the data they store. "These factors might cause these organizations to share their user data unethically," Lopes said. Developers face a hard decision regarding personal data and software design. They can create systems to exploit user data with the understanding that the liability lies with the organization, or they can raise concerns but face potential penalization for going against the project's aims. Modern technology companies' working culture should let developers come forward with personal data ownership concerns without fear of retaliation.

#### Algorithmic bias
Technology can amplify existing biases. "One of the more pressing ethical issues facing today's developers is bias," said Spencer Lentz, principal, AI and digital process automation, digital customer experience, at consulting firm Capgemini. Bias often enters the system undetected -- Lentz compares bias to a virus. Computers themselves have no inherent moral framework. Software can only learn from the training it is given. Therefore, developers and data scientists must scrub bias from the training data and the algorithms they build. From a developer's perspective, bias often centers on eliminating options for the wrong reasons, Lentz said. Reporting and research in recent years illustrates how bias within software systems can perpetuate systemic racism against specific populations, which creates lost opportunity, worsens medical care and increases rates of incarceration. For example, in the book, Race After Technology, Ruha Benjamin raised some concerns about a case where developers failed to include Black people's voices in training AI speech recognition algorithms, under the belief that fewer Black people would use the app. 

#### Weak security and PII (Personal Identifiable Information) protection
Application security is growing in importance as software plays a larger role in our online and offline environments. Developers often only address security after code release, rather than during development. As a result, the software community lacks secure development standards. Once a software product is publicly available, the focus shifts to new features and performance optimization, so security continues to have minimal prominence. Hackers and other malicious actors cause real damage to real people. Our current digital ecosystem tends to address application security by plugging vulnerabilities as they are found. The reactionary approach is neither practical nor pragmatic. To address this ethical responsibility for customer safety, developers need education, but typically only cybersecurity-specific classes address these topics.

#### Prioritizing features over impact
At the center of many ethical issues is a decision that capabilities in software releases are more important than the effects they could have. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. "If the development team is measured on their rate of feature development, there's a high probability that the ethics of a given implementation might not be front of mind, either at the design or at the implementation phase," said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at Synopsys Cyber Security Research Center. Synopsys is an electronic design automation company. The business itself must set the tone for ethical standards in its software. Reflect ethics priorities throughout software lifecycle from design to operation. Train staff on ethical choices such as open source software licensing and use. Teach developers, architects, testers and other software team members about data management practices that comply with regulations and customer expectations. Developers don't follow news on the latest legislative actions in the jurisdictions where customers use their software, Mackey pointed out, but the business must ensure they're informed.

### Ethical issues in my own project
One of the Ethical issues I've encountered in my own project is the Security and PII protection. Users of my application need to be logged in to create decks and to have access to their own created decks. In my research report about [Authentication](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/Research%20%26%20Documentation/Authentication.md) I've researched which way I wanted to implement the authentication for my app. Creating the authentication myself would leave chances for vulnerabilities in security for the users, that's why I choose to implement an existing authenticator, Auth0. This way most of the vulnerabilities are taken away. Another ethical dilemma is prioritizing features over impact. At first when I started my project, I made user stories and thought of features I wanted to implement and after that started coding to implement these features as fast as possible. After showing those features to the stakeholder, part of the feedback was that he wanted to ensure the Software Quality and not only the Quantity. So with this feedback I held the flow of features back and started creating tests and software checks to ensure cleaner, saver code, instead of pushing out a lot of features.


## Cultural Differences
### What is Culture?
Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. In other words you could say culture is the opposite of nature, since nature is everything you're born with and culture is everything you've learned.

### Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 
Cultural differences are the various beliefs, behaviors, languages, practices and expressions considered unique to members of a specific ethnicity, race or national origin. Some examples of cultural differences as they pertain to the workplace include employees who are younger or older than their co-workers, employees who hold higher degrees than others in the workplace and individuals who grew up in either metropolitan areas or small towns.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory is a framework for cross-cultural communication, developed by Geert Hofstede. It shows 6 dimensions on cultural differences.

![Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Hofstede.png)

- **Power distance index (PDI):** The power distance index is defined as "the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally". A higher degree of the Index indicates that hierarchy is clearly established and executed in society, without doubt or reason. A lower degree of the Index signifies that people question authority and attempt to distribute power.
- **Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV):** This index explores the "degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups". Individualistic societies have loose ties that often only relate an individual to his/her immediate family. They emphasize the "I" versus the "we". Its counterpart, collectivism, describes a society in which tightly integrated relationships tie extended families and others into in-groups. These in-groups are laced with undoubted loyalty and support each other when a conflict arises with another in-group.
- **Uncertainty avoidance (UAI):** The uncertainty avoidance index is defined as "a society's tolerance for ambiguity", in which people embrace or avert an event of something unexpected, unknown, or away from the status quo. Societies that score a high degree in this index opt for stiff codes of behavior, guidelines, laws, and generally rely on absolute truth, or the belief that one lone truth dictates everything and that people know what it is. A lower degree in this index shows more acceptance of differing thoughts or ideas. Society tends to impose fewer regulations, ambiguity is more accustomed to, and the environment is more free-flowing.
- **Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS):** In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness, and material rewards for success." Its counterpart represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values. This dimension is frequently viewed as taboo in highly masculine societies.
- **Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO):** This dimension associates the connection of the past with the current and future actions/challenges. A lower degree of this index (short-term) indicates that traditions are honored and kept, while steadfastness is valued. Societies with a high degree in this index (long-term) view adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving as a necessity. A poor country that is short-term oriented usually has little to no economic development, while long-term oriented countries continue to develop to a level of prosperity.
- **Indulgence vs. restraint (IND):** This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires. Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms".
