## Ethics
[Ehtical Issues I encountered](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/Research%20%26%20Documentation/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md#ethical-issues-in-my-own-project)

### What is ethics in Software Engineering?
For me I thought ethics is the act of justifying actions being right or wrong. After researching Ethics I found that Ethics is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) 

This explains the general meaning of ethics, but what is Ethics in software engineering? To create a general view on ethics in software engineering a Code of Ethics is introduced, which contains 8 principles. A short version of this Code can be on [Computer.org](https://www.computer.org/education/code-of-ethics). With the introduction of this Code of Ethics all software engineers have a guideline they can follow to ensure working ethically, but it's still their responsibility to take action in following these guidelines.

1. **PUBLIC:** Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. </br> 
This means software engineers should always put the public first, the intention of creating the software should always be to please/help the public, instead of making money, which can lead to dubious choices.
2. **CLIENT AND EMPLOYER:** Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest. </br>
In my opinion this comes close to the first point. The employer should always have the goal to please/help the public. The software engineer having the best interest for the client can only occur if the project isn't conflict with the first principle.
3. **PRODUCT:** Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible. </br> 
For me this point doesn't necessary have anything to do with ethics. For me it should always be the goal to create products in the best way you can. For me this should be standard for software engineers. You can't deliver a product that only partially functions or isn't secure.
4. **JUDGMENT:** Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment. </br> 
This point can in practice be a hard one. A software engineer could want to maintain integrity, but when their employer takes action towards the software engineer for not doing his job, the software engineers judgement can be biased.
5. **MANAGEMENT:** Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance. </br> 
This point and the previous point should in my opinion be 1 principle. Without hte management being ethical the softwar engineer, in practice does not always have a choice in being ethical. A lot of other factors can change his view in order to keep his job.
6. **PROFESSION:** Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest. </br> 
This means software engineers will have to keep adapting and learning during their career in order to stay on the same line with the public interest.
7. **COLLEAGUES:** Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. </br> 
I think this principle isn't necessarily a ethical point for a software engineer, but for every profession. To be an ethical person, you should always treat people right and support them.
8. **SELF:** Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession. </br> 
This principle has a lot in common wiht principle 6. In order to execute principle 6 a software engineer will have to keep on learing during their career.

The practice of ethics has not traditionally been a part of software development. Software didn't always have a direct impact on daily life, and the pace of development was slow. In modern society, people encounter software in all aspects of life, and big data and data analytics have real ramifications for individuals. Although software developers work primarily behind the scenes in businesses, their decisions in the course of a project can have an outsized impact in the world, for better or worse. Everyone in the industry should be aware of social and ethical issues in software development and thus the importance of Ethics in software engineering have increased a lot in the last years.

### Why is ethics important in Software Engineering?
There are 3 main points that indicate the importance of ethics in software engineering, it benefits the public, it meets professional standards & it provides high-quality software.

#### Ethics benefits the public 
Having a strict code of ethics guarantees that software engineers will create products that benefit everyday people. Without ethics, a software engineer could disregard how their work affects the lives of others, or design something that is intentionally harmful. Software should be looked upon as a tool to help our society function more efficiently. Without ethics, software engineers could get off scot-free for participating in reckless behaviour and decision-making. 

#### Ethics meets professional standards
Adhering to your own personal ethics isn’t enough. Professional standards governed by a code of ethics ensure that software engineers are able to justify their work. Rather than pursuing a goal without first thinking of its implications, employees in this field need to ask themselves a few ethical questions each time they embark on a new project. For example, a software engineer who is developing a new video game may ask themselves, “How can I make sure that the final product does not negatively impact a player’s quality of life?”. Having a code that meets professional standards also means that software engineers are part of a moral community of like-minded professionals and leaders with similar responsibilities. Remember, the influence of a good principal can never be erased!

#### Ethics provides high-wuality software
Software powers our world. It enables the functionality of our banks, communication, power plants, and nearly every other modern-day system. Ethics make certain these systems use high-quality, reliable software that is beneficial and accessible for everyone. According to the Code, software engineers must aim to create quality products that meet specifications, pass appropriate tests, and don’t diminish quality of life, privacy, or harm the environment. 

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work?
#### Ask yourself how the software could be misused 
Most engineers create software in good faith. Unfortunately, assuming that your product will be used for good isn’t enough. Each time you embark on a new project, ask yourself, “How could this software be misused?”. Be mindful that this answer may change as the product itself evolves. Ask yourself this question multiple times throughout the development process and each time you update it. For example, the team that developed Twitter did so with a mission to “give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly,” and likely didn’t think that the platform would one day be used to spread misinformation about a global pandemic or electoral processes. To offset some of this harm, Twitter platform implemented a crisis misinformation policy to guide their efforts to elevate credible information in 2022. As a software engineer, you should also look at existing technology you’ve worked on and be proactive about addressing potential misuse. 

#### Be honest about your intent
If you publicly announce that your new product will “connect individuals from across the globe” but your actual goal is to make the next greatest international dating app, you’re not adhering to software engineering ethics. Use simple language and be honest about your product! If the vision changes, inform your audience. Be open with stakeholders about software updates and changes as they arise. Work with other teams within your company to create policies that make sure the product will be used as intended. 

#### Avoid biases
If you’re an idealistic person, you probably get excited often about your own work. Don’t let enthusiasm cloud your judgment! Think carefully about your role as a digital changemaker and always ask for a second option if you’re questioning the ethicality of your work. Commit to the eight principles of the Code, which outlines how software engineers should be lifelong learners. If you’re a manager, strive to create a diverse team of software engineers who are able to share their own options and perspectives on each project your team undertakes.

#### Take accountability for the software 
If you have an awesome idea, take ownership for all successes and failures! As a software engineer, you should aim to advance the integrity and reputation of the profession. For example, you should avoid false claims about your software, but also declarations that could be deceptive or misleading. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in your software and ensure that your employer, clients, customers, and other stakeholders are kept up-to-date. 

#### Act as a responsible citizen
Software engineers have the unique opportunity to create a product that can unknowingly do good or cause harm. For this reason, you need to put your role as a responsible citizen first and as a software engineer second. You should only work on and move forward with the development of  software that you believe is safe, meets requirements, and can pass the necessary testing. You can also be a responsible citizen by volunteering your professional engineering skills to good causes when able. 

### Examples of Ethical issues in software engineering
There are a lot of ethical issues to consider when creating a project. Here I discuss 5 examples of ethical issues and consider if those issues could be an issue for my own project. The 5 examples are:
- Addictive design
- Corporate ownership of personal data
- Algorithmic bias
- Weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection
- Overemphasis on features

#### Addictive design
Every developer yearns to create applications that people love to use, that's just good UX design. The problem is that some teams craft apps that people love too much. There is an ethical concern about the role of digital platforms, such as social media. Striking an ethical balance between products consumers love and products that hijack their attention is more an art than a science. In product creation and updates, ask the following questions:
- Who benefits?
- How do they benefit?
- To what degree do they benefit?
- Are there safeguards for user health and sanity?
- How overt is monetization and customer data collection and use, including via AI and machine learning (ML)? How transparent are these practices?

#### Questionable personal data ownership
AI-based processing of biometric and other contextual data about customers has increased exponentially with device and software evolution. Software can profile users and predict behaviors at a scary level of detail. "Usually, the ethical question is what to do with that data," said Miguel Lopes, vice president of product line management at Vidyo, a video conference platform. This ethical issue is a dilemma for developers in every kind of business, not just the social media giants who make the news. An algorithm directs information collection and building a profile, but the subsequent actions are intentional, and the developer is ordinarily aware of the power of this data in context. One of the root causes of ethical concerns relates to how the business generates revenue and incentivizes developers and business managers, Lopes argued. In many cases, companies look at user data as a valuable currency, and want to monetize the data they store. "These factors might cause these organizations to share their user data unethically," Lopes said. Developers face a hard decision regarding personal data and software design. They can create systems to exploit user data with the understanding that the liability lies with the organization, or they can raise concerns but face potential penalization for going against the project's aims. Modern technology companies' working culture should let developers come forward with personal data ownership concerns without fear of retaliation.

#### Algorithmic bias
Technology can amplify existing biases. "One of the more pressing ethical issues facing today's developers is bias," said Spencer Lentz, principal, AI and digital process automation, digital customer experience, at consulting firm Capgemini. Bias often enters the system undetected -- Lentz compares bias to a virus. Computers themselves have no inherent moral framework. Software can only learn from the training it is given. Therefore, developers and data scientists must scrub bias from the training data and the algorithms they build. From a developer's perspective, bias often centers on eliminating options for the wrong reasons, Lentz said. Reporting and research in recent years illustrates how bias within software systems can perpetuate systemic racism against specific populations, which creates lost opportunity, worsens medical care and increases rates of incarceration. For example, in the book, Race After Technology, Ruha Benjamin raised some concerns about a case where developers failed to include Black people's voices in training AI speech recognition algorithms, under the belief that fewer Black people would use the app. 

#### Weak security and PII (Personal Identifiable Information) protection
Application security is growing in importance as software plays a larger role in our online and offline environments. Developers often only address security after code release, rather than during development. As a result, the software community lacks secure development standards. Once a software product is publicly available, the focus shifts to new features and performance optimization, so security continues to have minimal prominence. Hackers and other malicious actors cause real damage to real people. Our current digital ecosystem tends to address application security by plugging vulnerabilities as they are found. The reactionary approach is neither practical nor pragmatic. To address this ethical responsibility for customer safety, developers need education, but typically only cybersecurity-specific classes address these topics.

#### Prioritizing features over impact
At the center of many ethical issues is a decision that capabilities in software releases are more important than the effects they could have. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. "If the development team is measured on their rate of feature development, there's a high probability that the ethics of a given implementation might not be front of mind, either at the design or at the implementation phase," said Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at Synopsys Cyber Security Research Center. Synopsys is an electronic design automation company. The business itself must set the tone for ethical standards in its software. Reflect ethics priorities throughout software lifecycle from design to operation. Train staff on ethical choices such as open source software licensing and use. Teach developers, architects, testers and other software team members about data management practices that comply with regulations and customer expectations. Developers don't follow news on the latest legislative actions in the jurisdictions where customers use their software, Mackey pointed out, but the business must ensure they're informed.

### Ethical issues in my own project
One of the Ethical issues I've encountered in my own project is the Security and PII protection. Users of my application need to be logged in to create decks and to have access to their own created decks. In my research report about [Authentication](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/Research%20%26%20Documentation/Authentication.md) I've researched which way I wanted to implement the authentication for my app. Creating the authentication myself would leave chances for vulnerabilities in security for the users, that's why I choose to implement an existing authenticator, Auth0. This way most of the vulnerabilities are taken away. 

Since my application doesn't store any personal data you could say there's no ethical dilemma about the personal data ownership. Yet by implementing Auth0, which does store the personal data necesarry for my application, it's still my responsibility for using Auth0. But since 2018 the EU introduced the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a set of rules in order to protect the privacy of people. With the GDPR it also means people should be able to be informed about the data gathered from them, but the should also be able to delete this data. Since Auth0 is a business it must be able to prove they follow the rules of GDPR, otherwise they aren't allowed to do their business in the EU. With GDPR in mind I think it's safe to say using Auth0 is a good tool to make sure the personal data of users is safe.

By researching my project choices, the Frontend & Backend Framework and the database I excluded bias in my choices. I researched the frameworks and set the pros and cons next to each other resulting in choosing the right framework for my project.

Another ethical dilemma is prioritizing features over impact. At first when I started my project, I made user stories and thought of features I wanted to implement and after that started coding to implement these features as fast as possible. After showing those features to the stakeholder, part of the feedback was that he wanted to ensure the Software Quality and not only the Quantity. So with this feedback I held the flow of features back and started creating tests and software checks to ensure cleaner, saver code, instead of pushing out a lot of features.

In my future projects I want to address this earlier myself. This relates to one of the principles from the Code of Ethics, number 3 Product. Usually I'm too focused on creating visible progress, implementing more and more features. With this over focus on the features I tend to neglect the security and testing of those features, which means the product can become dubious. Although I myself only have good intentions with implementing the features, those untested features might become a vulnerability which people can abuse to hurt other user. Therefor I want to change my way of working for future projects in such a way, that when I deliver a feature I immediatly create tests and research to make it secure. 


## Cultural Differences
[What is my culture & which cultural differences have I experienced](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/Research%20%26%20Documentation/Cultural%20differences%20and%20ethics.md#what-is-my-culture)

### What is Culture?
Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups. Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. In other words you could say culture is the opposite of nature, since nature is everything you're born with and culture is everything you've learned.

### Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 
Cultural differences are the various beliefs, behaviors, languages, practices and expressions considered unique to members of a specific ethnicity, race or national origin. Some examples of cultural differences as they pertain to the workplace include employees who are younger or older than their co-workers, employees who hold higher degrees than others in the workplace and individuals who grew up in either metropolitan areas or small towns.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory is a framework for cross-cultural communication, developed by Geert Hofstede. It shows 6 dimensions on cultural differences.

![Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory](https://github.com/S3-HSDM/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Hofstede.png)

- **Power distance index (PDI):** The power distance index is defined as "the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally". A higher degree of the Index indicates that hierarchy is clearly established and executed in society, without doubt or reason. A lower degree of the Index signifies that people question authority and attempt to distribute power.
- **Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV):** This index explores the "degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups". Individualistic societies have loose ties that often only relate an individual to his/her immediate family. They emphasize the "I" versus the "we". Its counterpart, collectivism, describes a society in which tightly integrated relationships tie extended families and others into in-groups. These in-groups are laced with undoubted loyalty and support each other when a conflict arises with another in-group.
- **Uncertainty avoidance (UAI):** The uncertainty avoidance index is defined as "a society's tolerance for ambiguity", in which people embrace or avert an event of something unexpected, unknown, or away from the status quo. Societies that score a high degree in this index opt for stiff codes of behavior, guidelines, laws, and generally rely on absolute truth, or the belief that one lone truth dictates everything and that people know what it is. A lower degree in this index shows more acceptance of differing thoughts or ideas. Society tends to impose fewer regulations, ambiguity is more accustomed to, and the environment is more free-flowing.
- **Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS):** In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness, and material rewards for success." Its counterpart represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak, and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values. This dimension is frequently viewed as taboo in highly masculine societies.
- **Long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO):** This dimension associates the connection of the past with the current and future actions/challenges. A lower degree of this index (short-term) indicates that traditions are honored and kept, while steadfastness is valued. Societies with a high degree in this index (long-term) view adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving as a necessity. A poor country that is short-term oriented usually has little to no economic development, while long-term oriented countries continue to develop to a level of prosperity.
- **Indulgence vs. restraint (IND):** This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires. Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms".

### What is my culture
I think my culture is the traditinal dutch guy from a smaller village. If I would have to catogorize myself I would say I'm a silent, down-to-earth person, who melts when I'm in company where I'm at ease, not the typical bigger city person with lots of talk, which shows when I'm going out with friends. When I'm out with friends I enjoy talking mostly to my friends instead of socializing with others going out to the same club. The strangers I meet during an evening are mostly people got in touch with my friends.

### Cultural differences I've encountered in my life
During my time in middle school I've participated in a exchange project with other students from Latvia, Poland, Turkey and Spain. The exchange existed of three parts, one where students from those countries came to our place, one where the students went to Latvia and the one I participated in where we went to Poland. During these exchanges there were a few notable differences between the exchange students. The students from Poland seemed very friendly and social. They greeted every other student from their class and it looked like noone was left out. The other four countries, including ours, you could clearly see more grouping and not even greeting everybody from their class. </br>
Another clear difference during the exchange at our place was how straightforward the students from Turkey and Spain were. Each student had an exchange student from one of the countries in their house. The communication between the Dutch students, who had a Turkish or Spanish exchange student, went so well, we organized an evening outside of school together with all the students from Turkey and Spain and the Dutch who had an exchange student from that country. For me it seemed during that exchange that the student from Latvia and Poland were less talkative towards other students who were not from their country, but I might have been biased by the fact I had a Turkish exchange student and spoke less with the students from Poland and Latvia.
