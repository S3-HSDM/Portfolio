# Javascript Framework, React or Angular
### Sources
**React** is a Javascript based framework developed by Facebook. The things React has towards Angular are:
- Usage of [JSX](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_jsx.asp)
- Building Blocks Flexibility
- Isomorphic Javascript
- Single Data Binding

**Angular** is a Typescript based framework developed by Google. The things Angular has towards React are:
- MVC Model
- Dependency Injection
- Out-of-the-box Full Stack Framework
- Two-way Data Binding
- App Structure

Differences between the two Frameworks:
- Angular is used to build single-page applications using HTML and Typescript, where React is used to build user interfaces for single-page applications.
- React is component based, which has the advantage of reusable code.



### Conclusion
A big plus point to choose for Angular is the fact that this framework uses the MVC model.
