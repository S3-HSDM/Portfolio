# Javascript Framework, React or Angular
### Sources
**React** is a Javascript based framework developed by Facebook. The things React has towards Angular are:
- Usage of [JSX](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_jsx.asp)
- Building Blocks Flexibility
- Isomorphic Javascript
- Single Data Binding

**Angular** is a Typescript based framework developed by Google. The things Angular has towards React are:
- MVC Model
- Dependency Injection
- Out-of-the-box Full Stack Framework
- Two-way Data Binding
- App Structure

Differences between the two Frameworks:
- Angular is used to build single-page applications using HTML and Typescript, where React is used to build user interfaces for single-page applications.
- React is component based, which has the advantage of reusable code.

### Conclusion
From online research there isn't really a better choice for the Frontend. Both are developed by big companies, they are both around for a long time and both have a lot of documentation available. A big plus point for me to choose for Angular is the fact that this framework uses the MVC model. 

This advantage I experienced during a workshop from Mark Heumen in which he showed how to create a Frontend in Angular, with the REST API from the Backend quarkus workshop. After the workshop I tried to recreate the Frontend in React, but I found out really soon I didn't like that a react view has all the HTML and Javascript in 1 file, so I went with Angular for my IP.
