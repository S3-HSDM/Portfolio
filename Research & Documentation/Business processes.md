## What is a business process
A business process, business method or business function is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process. A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish.

## How does a business proces relate to software applications? 
From the video provided in Canvas Software applications support business processes. Before software all processes had to be processed by hand/on paper and be physically stored. With the help of software applications, and behind the software the hardware, those processes can be processed and stored digitally. Like keeping track of stock for a shop. A shop can nowadays easily keep track of their stock with the right software applications. With a software application the shop can keep track of all incoming and outgoing products and still know at any moment how many stock is left. Software helps making business processes more efficient.

From the workshop I've learned that these days Software is takes an important part in optimizing and automating business processes. With an automated process it becomes more efficient and faster, which creates more time for employees to do other tasks. Optimizing and automating these processes is called Business Process Management and consists of 5 steps:
- **Design:** This step is about analysing the business process. The goal of this step is to gain an understanding of the business process and ensuring you and the stakeholder have the same vision.
- **Modeling:** This step is about identifying the problem and creating a model about the new/altered processes to support the business process.
- **Execution:** During this step the model is executed and tested by a small group of users, after which it can be deployed to all users.
- **Monitoring:** Establish Key Performance Indicators and track the statistics. 
- **Optimization:** With the report a business can improve those processes toward optimization.

**Key Performance Indicators** are the critical quantifiable indicators of progress toward an intended result.

Business Process Management is never finished, because there is always something you can optimize, despite how small a process can be, which is why it's a cycle.

## Does your software automate a task, facilitate a task, or make a new task possible to perform? 
For our group project we have created a Is-It-Live application for World of Content (WoC). World of Content has a PIM system which make it more efficient to pass through product information for the webshop between Supplier and Retailer. Yet this process sometimes can (partially) go wrong and no data or the wrong data is displayed on the  webshop of the Retailer. For a Supplier it can be a lot of work to check the data of all their products on all the Retailers webshops. Therefor we have created a webshop scraper which automates this process. Since the Suppliers already have provided the correct data to WoC, we can use this data to compare to the found data on the webshops. In our application the Supplier can see if their product is available online and if so how much of the data corresponds. So our softtware automates a task.

## Which is the process that your software supports/automates? Can you visualize it in a diagram?
Before we created the Is-It-Live application the Supplier had to manually check all their products on all Retailers webshops themselves. With the implementation of Is-It-Live this process is more optimized. Instead of having to check their products one by one per webshop the application checks the products simultaneously and faster.

## Which roles are involved in this process? The work of which people (their roles) will this software influence? 
The roles involved in this process are Supplier, Retailer, WoC PIM system and our Is-It-Live application. With the implementation of our application the work of the supplier will be influenced. Before our application an employee of the supplier had to manually check their products, which could take easily hours if not days to do so. With our application this process is accelerated. Currently it takes less than a minute per webshop we have implemented.

## Which steps of the process does your software support/automate? Can you visualize the new process in a diagram?
