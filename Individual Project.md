# Individual Project (Hearthstone Deck Maker)
## Introduction
For my Individual Project I am going to make a Hearthstone Deck Maker. On this web application you can get an overview over all the cards available in the game, get an overview of created decks by all users of the application and a page to create a deck yourself. For the card overview I got my inspiration from the [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/cards?set=standard&sort=dateadded%3Adesc%2Cname%3Aasc%2Cclasses%3Aasc) site.

For the deck overview I got my inspiration mainly from [HearthPwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-show-standard=1&filter-show-constructed-only=y&filter-deck-tag=1) site.
