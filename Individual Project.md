# Individual Project (Hearthstone Deck Maker)
## Introduction
For my Individual Project I am going to make a Hearthstone Deck Maker. On this web application you can get an overview over all the cards available in the game, get an overview of created decks by all users of the application and a page to create a deck yourself. For the card overview I got my inspiration from the [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/cards?set=standard&sort=dateadded%3Adesc%2Cname%3Aasc%2Cclasses%3Aasc) site.

For the deck overview I got my inspiration mainly from [HearthPwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-show-standard=1&filter-show-constructed-only=y&filter-deck-tag=1) site.

## Project choices
For this project I work according to the Agile ideology. I do this by working with Scrum method. To keep track of my tasks and the sprints I use the Trelloboard Tool on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/S3-HSDM/projects/1). My sprints will be 3 weeks long.
The languages and frameworks I use for my Individual Project are Java Spring Boot for the Backand of the project and Javascript Angular for the Frontend. The reasoning for choosing these languages/frameworks are further explained in my research files.
