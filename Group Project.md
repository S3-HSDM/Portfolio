## Cultural differences and ethics
For cultural differences and ethics to some ethical questions in the world of software development and questioned myself where I draw the line for developing software like facial recognition and AI. Also I evaluated my own project for ethical questions.

## Business processes 
For business process I did research towards what a business process is. After the research I created a business process for a customer buying a product in a webshop, but since this process only describes 1 person who is also not part of the business, it didn't really describe a business process. That's why I made another business process of a customer online returning a product.
