# Group Project for World of Content; The Webshop Scraper Is-It-Live

## Cultural differences and ethics
For cultural differences and ethics to some ethical questions in the world of software development and questioned myself where I draw the line for developing software like facial recognition and ownership of personal data and the protection of this data, but also the design of webpages, which can be misleading or addictive. After that I evaluated my own project for ethical questions.

## Business processes 
For business process I did research towards what a business process is. After the research I created a business process for a customer buying a product in a webshop, but since this process only describes 1 person who is also not part of the business, it didn't really describe a business process. That's why I made another business process of a customer online returning a product.

## Agile method

# Group project for World of Content (WoC)
## Agile
As a team we chose to work the SCRUM agile method. So on a daily basis we had several meetings and created an environment where we summed up all of the issues withing the project. Every meeting we took the time to look at the issues and speak up your mind about problems that we were having. That meant that we could all help eachother out and work out the issues one by one.

## Issues
We created issues to keep track of all the things that we need to do as a team, to finish the project. Everyone can create issues, not everyone can assign them to one another. Every issue comes with it's own description and checklist of things that must be done to finish the issue.

## Working as a team
We managed to make it work as a team by making use of the agile method: SCRUM. Also by communicating to one another and having meetings offline- aswell as online. If anyone of us had a problem that we faced, there was always someone to help out and eliminate the issue. Before we started working on the project, we looked at everyones needs and what they wanted to do within the project. For example, Dirk and i are more interested in the frontend and dus React JS, so we started working on that. While te other team members decided to be more involved in the backend of the project, which worked well. Eventually we mamaged to make great progress every sprint and show WoC that we were able to create a webapp based on their requirements.

### What went right?
To be fair we actually managed to do pretty well as a team and split the issues among us all. The communication was great and everyone was excited to work on the project. Creating the issues and working with GitHub to have insights into eachoter's work was also a good thing. We Helped eachother out where we could and made great progress all along.

### What went wrong?
There were one or two sprint assignments where we had to show what we've been working on, but we did'nt prepare ourselfs well enough. Which lead to all being muted when we sat down and just staring at the one team member that brought the laptop to start talking. So, that was'nt so great. We did manage to create time to prepare ourselfs better for the next assignment.
